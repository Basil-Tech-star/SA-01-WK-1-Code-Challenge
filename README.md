## DESCRIPTION
This is a project carried out at the end of week 1 of phase-1 to demonstatrate my ability to practise so far in five days of the week in javascrpit language programming
It consists of 3 major categories of project solutions to be undertaken using the javascript language.
The cateogries include: Net-Salary-Calculator
                        Speed-Detector
                        Student-Grade-generator

### Net-Salary-Calculator
This is a solution of calcualating an individual's net salary after deducing the neccessary deductions from the gross salary.
It involves getting the gross salaary then deducting the (NHIF,NSSF,PAYE)
The results will be the Net Salary

### Speed Detector
This is a solution that looks at calaculating the speed of vehicle and outputing the valid message of ('OK') if the speedlimit is less than 70, while also giving merit points of 1 point for every 5km/s speed above the speed limit of(70).
If the merit points of a certain driver goes beyond 12 points the solution should output a message of "License suspended".
